## Biography
Author of this guide, I'm an open source developer, creative technologist and software coach. I'm [[Neurodivergent]] with ADHD - for years I've strugged to find a good system to keep all my information together.  My desk drawers are littered with half-filled notebooks, I use Google Keep for random notes, LucidChart for others - but it all gets disconnected.

This is not the first system I'm approached - systems should be novel, one never sticks around for more than a few weeks before a new one comes along.

I re-discovered [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|Obsidian]] after not finding it so user friendly - after watching a video from [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👤 Alexis Rondeau]] it finally clicked.

Within 24 hours I had created the 🌱 [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Planting Seeds|seed]] of this idea - a [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🗃 Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]] system that itself is a tutorial on how to build your own.  Each person, and each project, is different - so it needs to be organic.

Who know's if it'll stick - but with data portability and a great concept (once you get over the initial curve) I'm hoping it'll become one of my daily tools.

Hopefully you'll also find it useful - if you do reach out on Twitter or GitHub.
