# What is the 🪨 🌳 Obsidian Garden?
The 🪨  🌳 Obsidian Garden is an open source resource that is both a [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🗃 Knowledge Management|🗃 Knowledge Management System]] system and a friendly guide to creating your own [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden|🌳 Digital Garden]] in  [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|🪨 Obsidian]].

## 👨🏻‍🌾 👩‍🌾 Meet Our Gardeners

Through the guide you'll meet [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]] and [[👩‍🌾 Alice]] - our two *Knowledge Gardeners* - who will occasionally pop up to help you along with [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|🪨 Obsidian]].

[[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]] will show you how to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Planting Seeds|🌱 plant seeds]] (your thoughts, ideas, collected resources) and how to make them rich with content and data through [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link|links]], [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🏷 Using Tags|🏷 Tags]] and embedding content.

[[👩‍🌾 Alice]] will show you how to harvest your data - understanding the [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]] and how to [[Search]] and use [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link#Backlinks|Backlinks]] and [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link#Outlinks|Outlinks]]

### 🌺 The Garden Analogy
Gardening is one of my favorite hobbies - in my spare time I go to allotment with it's greenhouse, raised beds and bush orchard. There - I have to water almost daily, tend to the weeds, prune and support crops like tomatoes and peas, and generally nurture and tend to the space.

The process usually begins in spring when you sow your crops - either from seeds or cutting. At this stage most of your time and energy is something that will take time to see results.  It's a slow process - but as you tend to them gradually seedlings appear that can be planted in a new location.

Once planted, each crop requires specific tending needs - but all require water, nourishment and protection from slugs, bugs and insects.  Done well - by the end of summer you will be have been rewarded with a rich harvest of fruits and vegetables.

With the [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden|🌳 Digital Garden]] we want to achieve the same, but with great ideas as the bounty.

### 🧑🏻‍💻 Becoming a Knowledge Gardener
[[👨‍👧‍👦 People/🧑🏻‍💻 Tane Piper|🧑🏻‍💻 I've]] tried several systems and invented a few myself (ask most people with ADHD - they'll have done the same). For me nothing has ever stuck - I even tried [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|🪨 Obsidian]] before - but previously found it's UI difficult and there wasn't much clear documentation.

After more recently discussing note taking apps I decided to give it a try again - I watched [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👤 Alexis Rondeau]]'s video [How to use Obsidian to write a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4AeGY2mz4) - after this something just *clicked*.  

Within hours I already had things close to how I liked it. Within 24 hours I was creating a working system based on the garden idea, and digging into how Obsidian with [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨 Obsidian/🔌 Plugins]] worked.

This guide is my collection of the discoveries I've made in doing this, with the hope that what I share can help on you on your way to becoming a knowledge gardener

## Principles

### Rich Templates and Content
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/⚠️ Statuses]]

Each template file contains a set of [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Front Matter|Front Matter]] properties, the most important being `status`.  The defaults for the field are sensible: `triage`, `ready`, `in progress` and `done`.  Using these allows queries to be generated that show a particular status.  The field is customisable, and there are more properties available in each template - so feel free to use your own to build more complex query sets.

### Query-driven pages
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🎯  Create Custom Dashboards]]

Query-driven pages live at the top level of the garden, for example [[📚 Reading]] and [[👨‍👧‍👦 People]], as well as the [[👩‍🌾 Your Knowledge Garden]] file. These allow quick access to pages that let you see the underlying data in your files.
