# What is the 🪨 🌳 Obsidian Garden?
The 🪨 🌳 Obsidian Garden is an open source resource that is both a [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management System]] system and a guide to creating your own [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/🌳 Digital Garden|🌳 Digital Garden]] in  [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|Obsidian]].

## 👨🏻‍🌾 👩‍🌾 Meet Our Gardeners

Through the guide you'll meet [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]] and [[👩‍🌾 Alice]] - our two *Knowledge Gardeners*.

[[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👨🏻‍🌾 Bob]] will show you how to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Creating Seeds|🌱 plant seeds]] (your thoughts, ideas, collected resources) and how to make them rich with content and data through [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link|links]], [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🏷 Using Tags|🏷 Tags]] and embedding content.

[[👩‍🌾 Alice]] will show you how to harvest your data - understanding the [[📇 Terms/🧠 Knowledge Systems/Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]] and how to [[Search]] and use [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link#Backlinks|Backlinks]] and [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Link#Outlinks|Outlinks]]

### The Garden Analogy
I myself enjoy gardening - both in my own back yard, and an allotment with greenhouse, raised beds and berry bushes.  As you learn the ways of gardening it helps see how nurturing and growing plants leads to a rewarding harvest.

First you need to sow your crops - either from seeds or cutting  ([[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Creating Seeds]]).  This stage is slow, you are planting in the hope that some will come up.  The one's that do, you transport to your growing area - carefully planting the, providing them nourishment and water and keeping beasts at bay from destroying them - this stage is also slow, and takes effort - but within a few weeks or months you are rewarded with a rich harvest of fruits and vegetables

This is the same with ideas - I'm constantly coming up with lots - but have them across lots of different paper and app locations and it's difficult to see the connections - by having this garden

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Building a guide for myself 
Like any person with ADHD, [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/🧑🏻‍💻 Tane Piper|I've]] tried several systems and invented a few myself - for me nothing has ever stuck - I even tried [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|Obsidian]] before - but found it's UI difficult and not much help.

Things change, and ideas grow - after discussing note taking apps I decided to give it a try again - I watched [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👤 Alexis Rondeau]]'s video [How to use Obsidian to write a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4AeGY2mz4) - after this something just *clicked*.  

Within hours I already had things close to how I liked it. Within 24 hours I was creating a working system. As I did this, I documented the changes I made - which I have turned in to this guide.

## Principles

### Consistent Front Matter
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/⚠️ Statuses]]

Each template file contains a set of [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Front Matter|Front Matter]] properties, the most important being `status`.  The defaults for the field are sensible: `triage`, `ready`, `in progress` and `done`.  Using these allows queries to be generated that show a particular status.  The field is customisable, and there are more properties available in each template - so feel free to use your own to build more complex query sets.

### Sensible Templates
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🌱 Creating Seeds]]

Each template also has a sensible set of default layouts and purpose - for example the [[⏣ Templates/📙 New Reading Item]] template has sections for quotes, questions and reviews.

### Query-driven pages
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪴 Sowing Your Garden/🎯 Create Custom Dashboards]]

Query-driven pages live at the top level of the garden, for example [[📚 Reading]] and [[👨‍👧‍👦 People]], as well as the [[👩‍🌾 Your Knowledge Garden]] file. These allow quick access to pages that let you see the underlying data in your files.
