## File Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for an ignore file (`.obsidianignore`) that allows files and folders to be added that [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/🪨 Obsidian|Obsidian]] will ignore and not load into the UI or consider in the database
- [ ] Add a [[📇 Terms/🪨 Obsidian/Front Matter|Front Matter]] property `ignore: true` that when added removes the file from the graph - useful for template files and other files that are temporary.
- [ ] Add a property `icon` that allows for an icon to be displayed along side the file name, but that does not need to be part of it

## UX Improvements

- [ ] Provide API access to the context menu in the editor
- [ ] In Backlinks / Outgoing links, be able to remove mentions to a third "Resolved Mentions" accordian that can be kept closed and have a "Mark as Resolved"
- [ ] Fix undo history disappearing when switching between preview and editing
