# 🪨🌱 The Obsidian Garden

## Welcome to your Knowledge Garden

![The Knowledge Garden](.github/the-knowledge-garden.png)

The [Obsidian Garden](https://obsidian.garden) is both guide in helping you create your own knowledge system, and a knowledge system itself.

It's designed to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - a tool for creating knowledge bases and *"second brain"* using connected links and tags between documents to generate a knowledge graph.

> At this time the project is in active development and subject to changes, it also contains spelling and grammar mistakes that will be reviewed later.

While this project uses Markdown, GitHub cannot render them.  You can view it on the Obsidian publishing platform at  [https://obsidian.garden](https://obsidian.garden).

Be aware that the publishing platform currently does not support community plugins - to get the full experience, clone this repository and use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to view.
